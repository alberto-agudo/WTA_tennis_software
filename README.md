# WTA_tennis_software
This is the code for my final Programming assignment. The main aim was to build software to analyze WTA matches and new algorithms for ranking WTA players.

The functions are stored in .py files, which are used for the main analysis tasks as shown in the 01_WTA_analisys.ipynb.
